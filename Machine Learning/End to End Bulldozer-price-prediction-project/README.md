Hi, 
In this project, I solved Blue Book for bulldozers from Kaggle, hope u like it...
https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview

In this project a regression model is created to predict the sale price of bulldozers sold at auctions. It was implemented using pandas, numpy, matplotlib and model from sckit-learn
<br />
NOTE : before opening end-to-end-bulldozer-price-regression plz make sure that u have ur own conda enviroment including numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib libraries...
