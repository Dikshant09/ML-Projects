Hi, 
In this project, I solved Blue Book for bulldozers from Kaggle, hope u like it...

NOTE : before opening end-to-end-bulldozer-price-regression plz make sure that u have ur own enviroment including numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib libraries...

Due to 25mb size restriction i made a zip of data file. I uploaded all the data material on google drive link, So download data before opening model
