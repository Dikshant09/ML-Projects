In this project, I solved Blue Book for bulldozers from Kaggle, hope u like it...
https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview

NOTE : before opening end-to-end-bulldozer-price-regression plz make sure that u have ur own conda enviroment including numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib libraries...

Due to 25mb size restriction i made a zip of data file. If zip files aren't working then download all the data material from google drive link....
